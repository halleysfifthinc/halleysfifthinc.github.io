C3D.jl is a library for reading and writing `.c3d` files from Julia.

```{julia}
#| echo: false
#| output: false
ENV["COLUMNS"] = 60

using Artifacts

sample01_sha = artifact_hash("sample01", find_artifacts_toml(pwd()))
sample01_path = artifact_path(sample01_sha)
fn = joinpath(sample01_path, "Eb015pr.c3d")
```

```{julia}
using C3D
pc_real = readc3d(fn #= artifact"sample01/Eb015pr.c3d" =#)
```

Working with `.c3d` files is the standard for for motion capture and other biomechanics related measurement data (force plates, EMG, etc). I developed this Julia package to meet my own needs and to (hopefully) foster/enable other biomechanists' exploration and experimentation with using Julia for their own analyses.

C3D.jl is thoroughly tested against the sample files from many different manufacturers/software versions available on [c3d.org](https://www.c3d.org/sampledata.html), and should be able to read/write any well-formed `.c3d` file (and even a number of ill-formed files).
