Hi, I'm Allen. I'm currently finishing my PhD in Human Kinetics (biomechanics) at the University of Ottawa. I'm passionate about developing rigorous methods, and improving user/developer/researcher experiences and productivity by making new tools or smoothing rough edges in existing tools. I'd like to continue working with biosignals/physiological data after finishing my PhD.

In my free time, I love reading scifi/fantasy, running, mountain biking, and woodworking.
