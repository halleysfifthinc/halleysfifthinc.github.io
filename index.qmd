Hi, I'm Allen. I've recently finished my PhD in Human Kinetics (biomechanics) at the
University of Ottawa. I'm passionate about developing rigorous methods, and improving
user/developer/researcher experiences and productivity by making new tools or smoothing
rough edges in existing tools. I'm interested in continuing to work with
biosignals/physiological data.

In my free time, I love reading scifi/fantasy, running, mountain biking, and woodworking.
