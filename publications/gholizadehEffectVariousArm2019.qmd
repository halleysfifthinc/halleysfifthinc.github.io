title: The effect of various arm and walking conditions on postural dynamic stability when recovering from a trip perturbation
date: 26 December 2019
abstract: >
  **Background**


  Appropriately responding to unexpected perturbations, such as a trip, is
  critical to sustain balance and avoid falling during walking.


  **Research question**


  How do arm motion and walking asymmetry affect postural stability when
  recovering from a trip perturbation?


  **Methods**


  Fifteen healthy young individuals, who had no experience with treadmill
  induced perturbations, participated in this study. The Computer-Assisted
  Rehabilitation Environment system (CAREN-Extended) was used to simulate
  unexpected perturbations while walking symmetrically and asymmetrically with
  various arm swings (normal, bound, released). Whole-body angular momentum
  (WBAM), peak trunk angular velocities, Center of Mass (COM), step width and
  stance time were analyzed before and when recovering from trip
  perturbations.


  **Results**


  Participants were able to recover their postural stability within three
  strides following the sudden anterior-posterior trip perturbation. The
  perturbation increased peak trunk angular velocity, the COM excursion and
  WBAM but did not affect stance time and step width. The arm conditions had
  significant effects on peak trunk angular velocity, WBAM and step width
  during pre-perturbation. Walking conditions had a significant effect on all
  variables during pre-perturbation; however, post-perturbation showed
  significant effects only for peak trunk angular velocity, WBAM, and COM.


  **Significance**


  Unexpected perturbation had effects on most of gait variables; nevertheless,
  participants fully recovered and adapted their gait pattern to sudden
  perturbations even without using their arms while walking symmetrically and
  asymmetrically. Arm movements could help young individuals recover after a
  perturbation but are not essential for perturbations of moderate magnitude.
  The effect of medial-lateral perturbations on gait still need to be
  investigated.
