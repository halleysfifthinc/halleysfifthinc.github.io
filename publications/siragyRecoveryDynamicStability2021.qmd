  Recovery of dynamic stability during slips unaffected by arm swing in people
  with Parkinson’s Disease
date: April 6, 2021
abstract: >-
    The arm elevation strategy assists in recovering stability during slips in
    healthy young and elderly individuals. However, in people with Parkinson’s
    Disease, one of the main motor symptoms affecting the upper limbs is reduced
    arm swing which intensifies throughout the course of the disease before
    becoming absent. This holds direct implications for these individuals when
    encountering slips as the arm elevation strategy is an integral component in
    the interlimb slip response to restore stability. Arm swing’s effect in
    recovering from slips in people with Parkinson’s Disease though remains
    unexamined. Twenty people with Parkinson’s Disease (63.78 ± 8.97 years)
    walked with restricted and unrestricted arm swing conditions on a dual-belt
    treadmill where slips were induced on the least and most affected sides.
    Data were collected on the CAREN Extended System (Motek Medical, Amsterdam,
    NL). The Margin of Stability, linear and angular trunk velocities, as well
    as step length, time, and width were calculated. Data were examined during
    the slipped step and recovery step. The restricted arm swing condition,
    compared to unrestricted, caused a faster step time during the slipped step.
    Compared to the most affected leg, the least affected had a wider step width
    during the slipped step. During the recovery step, the least affected leg
    had a larger anteroposterior Margin of Stability and longer step time than
    the most affected. No differences between our arm swing conditions suggests
    that the normal arm swing in our participants was not more effective at
    restoring stability after an induced slip compared to when their arm motion
    was restricted. This may be due to the arm elevation strategy being
    ineffective in counteracting the slip’s backward destabilization in these
    individuals. Differences between the legs revealed that our participants
    were asymmetrically impaired in their slip recovery response.
