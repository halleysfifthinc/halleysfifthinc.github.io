  Reaching and stepping respond differently to medication and cueing in
  Parkinson’s disease
date: 2024/10/18
abstract: >-
  The basal ganglia contribute to internal timekeeping, and dopaminergic
  medication has been observed to moderate timing deficits associated with
  Parkinson’s Disease (PD) during single joint movements. However, it is
  unclear whether similar effects can be observed in multi-joint movements.
  Twenty-five people with PD and twelve healthy peers performed repetitive
  reaching and stepping-in-place tasks with and without auditory cues at their
  self-selected maximal cadence. The PD group was measured ON and OFF
  medication. Reduced cadence error was found for both groups and tasks when
  cued, and ON PD exhibited decreased cadence compared to OFF PD. Overall
  timing variability was no different from controls, but differences were
  found in estimates of clock and motor variance using the Wing-Kristofferson
  model of interval timing. A medication and cueing interaction during the
  reaching task produced increased clock variance in uncued, ON PD. During the
  stepping task, clock and motor variance of the PD group were unaffected by
  cues, in contrast to the control group. Serial lag-one correlation was
  reduced in both groups for cued reaching, but was unaffected by cueing or
  medication in the PD group when stepping-in-place. These findings suggest
  that overall timing variability may not capture timing deficits in PD.
