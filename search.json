If you use Zotero from multiple devices (e.g.¬†different computers, iPad, etc.), you will likely want to access that stored PDF from all of your devices. So, Zotero offers a built-in cloud storage service to sync PDFs and other attached content in your library between devices; the free tier has 300Mb of storage, but they offer paid tiers for 2 Gb, 6 Gb, and ‚Äúunlimited‚Äù storage. For years, the size of all the attachments in my library has been well over the free storage provided by Zotero (I have ~2500 references and 2.5Gb of attachments). However, the 6 Gb and unlimited storage tiers have much more storage than I currently need and/or are more expensive than I would like1. Because of this, I‚Äôve been storing my reference attachments in Dropbox for years2. However, the Zotero iOS app does not support using Dropbox for storage.\nThankfully, Zotero supports an alternative file syncing method, WebDAV, which is a file server you can run yourself. Here‚Äôs how I setup a self-hosted WebDAV server to store the PDFs in my Zotero library."

    "section": "The WebDAV server",
    "text": "The WebDAV server\nI initially tried to setup an Apache WebDAV server, but after spending several hours without much success, I discovered that there is a WebDAV module for Caddy. Caddy is a powerful server with a very simple configuration system. I was already somewhat familiar with Caddy from setting up a Home Assistant server, and I soon had a functioning Caddy WebDAV server! The configuration was simpler than the setup guide(s) I had been following for Apache, and Caddy is also great because it has automatic HTTPS3.\nThe WebDAV module for Caddy isn‚Äôt built in, so visit the Caddy downloads page and add the WebDAV module, or you can use xcaddy to build it yourself4:\n$ xcaddy build --with github.com/mholt/caddy-webdav\nHere is the entire Caddyfile configuration for a WebDAV server:\n\n\nCaddyfile\n\nlocalhost:8337 {\n1    root * /location/of/your/files\n    encode gzip zstd\n\n    handle /webdav/* {\n      route {\n2          basic_auth {\n              # your-username your-password-hash\n              allen $2a$14$0PDIH55BWjgFKdh23tL3nuga1mjVy29lJtXMtaheIUxMz.oPO72a2\n          }\n          rewrite /webdav/zotero /webdav/zotero/ # add a trailing slash if missing\n3          webdav /webdav/zotero/* {\n              prefix /webdav/zotero/\n          }\n      }\n    }\n\n    respond 404 # all requests not to `/webdav/*` get a 404\n}\n\n\n1\n\nThe root directive sets the base directory that all other matchers and directives will be relative to.\n\n2\n\nThe basicauth directive will only allow someone with the right username and password to access your files. The username can be anything, while the password hash is generated by the interactive caddy hash-password command. You will be asked to enter your password5, and then it will print the hash for you to copy-paste into the Caddyfile. (The password hash in the example file is for the password hunter2.)\n\n3\n\nThe webdav module adds the WebDAV functionality. Zotero implicitly adds a \"/zotero/\" suffix to any WebDAV URL, so the matcher after the webdav must always end with \"/zotero/\". The prefix directive is optional, depending on if you don‚Äôt want your Zotero attachments nested under a zotero folder (or whatever you have as the matcher after webdav) within /location/of/your/files.\n\n\n You should now have a functioning WebDAV server! You can test it by running curl --user allen:hunter2 https://localhost:8337/webdav/zotero/ -X PROPFIND6 on your server. However, this server is only accessible locally, which won‚Äôt be very useful. Enter Cloudflare Tunnel!You will probably want to add/enable Caddy as a service (e.g.¬†with systemd) so that it starts automatically when the server reboots (or loses power)."

    "section": "Cloudflare Tunnel",
    "text": "Cloudflare Tunnel\nCloudflare Tunnel lets you route traffic to and from your local server through Cloudflare‚Äôs network. This lets you make your server publically accessible on the Internet without opening/forwarding a port on your router or needing to set up dynamic DNS.\nFirst, you will need a (free) account with Cloudflare. Then follow Cloudflare‚Äôs guide to creating a tunnel, via the CLI or via their web dashboard. The Cloudflare guide will walk you through installing the cloudflared process and creating a tunnel. Don‚Äôt forget to add/enable cloudflared as a service!\nYour tunnel configuration file should look like this (except with your own, real UUID‚Äôs of course):\n\n\nconfig.yml\n\ntunnel: 6b925f98-6ef3-11ef-149c-dd02d2f6d86f\ncredentials-file: /var/lib/cloudflared/6b925f98-6ef3-11ef-149c-dd02d2f6d86f.json\n\ningress:\n1  - hostname: zotero.example.com\n2    service: https://localhost:8337\n3    originRequest:\n      noTLSVerify: true\n4  - service: http_status:404\n\n\n1\n\nhostname is the public hostname that you will tell Zotero to connect to.\n\n2\n\nservice is the location that your Caddy server is responding to/from. It must (afaict) be a port on localhost. The protocol can be http://... unless you want to (optionally) encrypt your internal traffic, where it would need to be https://.... Either way, it should match your Caddy configuration; without an explicit http:// prefix, Caddy will default to https and generates a self-signed certificate.\n\n3\n\nSetting the originRequest configuration isn‚Äôt needed unless you are using https between cloudflared and Caddy. If you want your internal traffic (between the Cloudflare tunnel and your Caddy server) to be encrypted7, you can use either a self or CA signed certificate: By default, Caddy will automatically generate a self-signed certificate for localhost addresses. The above Caddyfile and tunnel config.yml files are showing this setup. The noTLSVerify: true stops cloudflared from attempting to verify the self-signed certificate. To use a CA signed certificate, you will need to configure Caddy appropriately for your CA (tutorials abound), and set an appropriate address in your Caddyfile. It must be different than the hostname of your tunnel (which will already have a certificate generated by Cloudflare). Then set the httpHostHeader and originServerName options in your tunnel config.yml to the address in your Caddyfile. noTLSverify is not necessary for this configuration.\n\n4\n\nThis configures the tunnel to respond to any other requests with a 404.\n\n\nNow that your WebDAV server is publically accessible, configure Zotero to use your server for file syncing. On the desktop, this is Edit -&gt; Settings -&gt; Sync -&gt; File Syncing. On iOS, this is &lt; Back, then the gear/settings icon, Account -&gt; File Syncing. Then change the ‚ÄúSync attachment files in My Library using‚Äù to \"WebDAV\", and enter your Cloudflare Tunnel domain and credentials for your Caddy server. Don‚Äôt forget to confirm it works by clicking the ‚ÄúVerify server‚Äù button!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZotero file sync dialog on Linux\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZotero file sync dialog on iPadOS\n\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy your self-hosted Zotero storage! I‚Äôve been running this setup on a Raspberry Pi-type single-board computer for almost 2 years with basically no maintenance and no downtime, besides updating Caddy and cloudflared occasionally. My Cloudflare tunnel even seamlessly dealt with a cross-country move to a new/different router with no reconfiguration needed."

The Computer-Assisted\n    Rehabilitation Environment system (CAREN-Extended) was used to\n    simulate unexpected perturbations while walking symmetrically and\n    asymmetrically with various arm swings (normal, bound, released).\n    Whole-body angular momentum (WBAM), peak trunk angular velocities,\n    Center of Mass (COM), step width and stance time were analyzed\n    before and when recovering from trip perturbations. **Results**\n    Participants were able to recover their postural stability within\n    three strides following the sudden anterior-posterior trip\n    perturbation. The perturbation increased peak trunk angular\n    velocity, the COM excursion and WBAM but did not affect stance time\n    and step width.

Previous studies suggest that\n    commonly used discrete symmetry metrics, which compare single\n    bilateral variables, may not be equally sensitive to underlying\n    effects of asymmetry, and the use of a metric with low sensitivity\n    could result in unnecessarily low statistical power. The purpose of\n    this study was to provide a comprehensive assessment of the\n    sensitivity of commonly used discrete symmetry metrics to better\n    inform design of future studies. Monte Carlo simulations were used\n    to estimate the statistical power of each symmetry metric at a range\n    of asymmetry magnitudes, group/condition variabilities, and sample\n    sizes. Power was estimated by repeated comparison of simulated\n    symmetric and asymmetric data with a paired t-test, where the\n    proportion of significant results is equivalent to the power.\n    Simulation results confirmed that not all common discrete symmetry\n    metrics are equally sensitive to reference effects of asymmetry.\n    Multiple symmetry metrics exhibit equivalent sensitivities, but the\n    most sensitive discrete symmetry metric in all cases is a bilateral\n    difference (e.g. left‚Äîright). A ratio (e.g. left/right) has poor\n    sensitivity when group/condition variability is not small, but a\n    log-transformation produces increased sensitivity. Additionally, two\n    metrics which included an absolute value in their definitions showed\n    increased sensitivity when the absolute value was removed.

It has yet to be determined what impact arm swing has on\n    postural strategies and gait stability during sloped walking. We\n    investigated the potentially interacting effects of surface slope\n    and arm motion on gait stability and postural strategies in healthy\n    young adults. We tested 15 healthy adults, using the CAREN-Extended\n    system to simulate a rolling-hills environment which imparted both\n    incline (uphill) and decline (downhill) slopes (¬± 3¬∞). This protocol\n    was completed under three imposed arm swing conditions: held,\n    normal, active. Spatiotemporal gait parameters, mediolateral margin\n    of stability, and postural kinematics in anteroposterior (AP),\n    mediolateral (ML), and vertical (VT) directions were assessed. Main\n    effects of conditions and interactions were evaluated by 2-way\n    repeated measures analysis of variance. Our results showed no\n    interactions between arm swing and slope; however, we found main\n    effects of arm swing and main effects of slope. As expected, uphill\n    and downhill sections of the rolling-hills yielded opposite stepping\n    and postural strategies compared to level walking, and active and\n    held arm swings led to opposite postural strategies compared to\n    normal arm swing. Arm swing effects were consistent across slope\n    conditions. Walking with arms held decreased gait speed, indicating\n    a level of caution, but maintained stability comparable to that of\n    walking with normal arm swing. Active arm swing increased both step\n    width variability and ML-MoS during downhill sections. Alternately,\n    ML-MoS was larger with increased step width and double support time\n    during uphill sections compared to level, which demonstrates that\n    distinct base of support strategies are used to manage arm swing\n    compared to slope. The variability of the rolling-hills also\n    required proactive base of support changes despite the mild slopes\n    to maintain balance.}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nMacDonald, Mary-Elise, Tarique Siragy, Allen Hill, and Julie Nantel.\n2022. ‚ÄúWalking on Mild Slopes and Altering Arm Swing Each Induce\nSpecific Strategies in Healthy Young Adults.‚Äù Frontiers in\nSports and Active Living 3 (January). https://doi.org/10.3389/fspor.2021.805147."

However, in\n    people with Parkinson‚Äôs Disease, one of the main motor symptoms\n    affecting the upper limbs is reduced arm swing which intensifies\n    throughout the course of the disease before becoming absent. This\n    holds direct implications for these individuals when encountering\n    slips as the arm elevation strategy is an integral component in the\n    interlimb slip response to restore stability. Arm swing‚Äôs effect in\n    recovering from slips in people with Parkinson‚Äôs Disease though\n    remains unexamined. Twenty people with Parkinson‚Äôs Disease (63.78 ¬±\n    8.97 years) walked with restricted and unrestricted arm swing\n    conditions on a dual-belt treadmill where slips were induced on the\n    least and most affected sides. Data were collected on the CAREN\n    Extended System (Motek Medical, Amsterdam, NL). The Margin of\n    Stability, linear and angular trunk velocities, as well as step\n    length, time, and width were calculated. Data were examined during\n    the slipped step and recovery step. The restricted arm swing\n    condition, compared to unrestricted, caused a faster step time\n    during the slipped step. Compared to the most affected leg, the\n    least affected had a wider step width during the slipped step.\n    During the recovery step, the least affected leg had a larger\n    anteroposterior Margin of Stability and longer step time than the\n    most affected. No differences between our arm swing conditions\n    suggests that the normal arm swing in our participants was not more\n    effective at restoring stability after an induced slip compared to\n    when their arm motion was restricted. This may be due to the arm\n    elevation strategy being ineffective in counteracting the slip‚Äôs\n    backward destabilization in these individuals. Differences between\n    the legs revealed that our participants were asymmetrically impaired\n    in their slip recovery response.}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nSiragy, Tarique, Allen Hill, and Julie Nantel. 2021. ‚ÄúRecovery of\nDynamic Stability During Slips Unaffected by Arm Swing in People with\nParkinson‚Äôs Disease.‚Äù PLOS ONE 16 (4): e0249303. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0249303."
